# CVE-2023-5360-Scan

## About
This is simple scanner for [CVE-2023-5360](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-5360) The Royal Elementor Addons and Templates plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.78. This is due to insufficient file type validation in the handle_file_upload() function called via AJAX which allows attackers to supply a preferred filetype extension to the ‘allowed_file_types‘ parameter, with a special character, which makes it possible for the uploaded file to bypass their filter list.
